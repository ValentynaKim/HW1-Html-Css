           <p>Hi! Welcome to my page! Glad that you're here! I will introduce myself. My name is Artur. I was born in Russia in 1995.
              I graduated high school where I played in basketball team. As for me, basketball is the best game! You should run fast, think smart and be a team player.
              After high scholl I graduated a musical college as a violinist teacher and perfomancer. Student years have been the best time in my life! Musical poeople are so special!
              We went to theaters, musiams, concerts together. So boring? Believe me, every time in this events was so funny and informative!
              We haven't been as most students: we should practice with our instruments very a lot!
              My longest practice is 12 hours without any break!</p>                
        <br>
            <p> I came in California 3 years ago. Once a year I fly to another country and one month ago I've been in Tailand. I visited lots of temples and hugged a small elephant!
            I like travelling and plan to visit all countries! </p>
            <br>
            <p>At this time, I live in Daly City, California for 3 years. I'd like to be a web developer and that's why I really glad to be in a UC Berkeley Boot Camp.</p>
